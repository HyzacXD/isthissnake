# Snake Game

A classic Snake game implemented in Python using Pygame.

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # on macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate      # on Windows

oh and u probably want to do ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

if you want a custom background, slide a .png (has to be .png) into the directory and select it in the settings icon.
